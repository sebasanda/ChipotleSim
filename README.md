# ChipotleSim

This Simio project was developed for a course in UCF.
The project was developed and contructed by me while my peers wrote the reports and assisted with the time study for this project.
The data collection and analysis was done by Aleena Voorhees, Alexandra Dumas, Matthew Silver, Randa Yasin and Tayah Allen.

The simio project consisted of studying and improving a real world queue system. Chipotle was chosen due to its close proximity to campus and the location's notoriously long wait times.

After a preliminary time study it seened evident the issue was near the end of the queue. The cashier posed an issue for the queue as they either had to stop the queue to ask for sides, were not present due to handling online/pickup orders or were simply slower than the assembly. 

The queue is composed of two customers, pickup customers - they go directly go to the cashier and skip the assembly and ordering customers- they go through the entire queue.

There are two main stations, the assembly and the cashier. The assembly is comprised of two workers, while the cashier is comprised of only one.

I created 3 improving scenarios to test their efficiencies, the first being adding a cashier, this improved times signifcantly. The second being online orders being processed by the main line. This significantly reduced wait times as well. The last scenario included both an additional cashier and online order processing.

There are various issues that need to be addressed with this model, such as food availability, physical queue space, and frequency of pickup orders.
The time study and assumptions also make it difficult to accurately model the real world establishment.
